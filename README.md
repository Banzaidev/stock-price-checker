# Stock Price Checker

This project is based on the boilerplate code provided by [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org/learn/information-security/information-security-projects/stock-price-checker) for the Stock Price Checker project.  

The code is distributed under the MIT License, which allows for modification, distribution, and use of the code. In this project, I have made customizations—including updates to the CSS and other modifications—while maintaining proper credit to the original source.

## Credits
